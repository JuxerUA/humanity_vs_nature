  "ohNonlooksLikeThisPlanetIsDoomedWellAtLeast": "Oh, no! Looks like this planet is doomed üòü\n\nWell, at least it's only a game üòÖ Maybe there's another way to make things right.\n\nGood luck!",
  "congratulationsntheGeneralLevelOfAwarenessAmongCitizensHasReachedA": "Congratulations! üòÅ\n\nThe general level of awareness among citizens has reached a level of no return. Global warming is no longer a threat to us! We can breathe again üòÖ\n\nCongratulations again!",
  "citiesLikeToLetOutBulldozersToClearSomeMore": "Cities create bulldozers to make more space for fields and farms. Bulldozers can be useful for you too, because they make space for new trees too üòâ",
  "agricultureIsTheLeadingCauseOfDeforestationOnThePlanet": "Agriculture is the main cause of deforestation on the planet.",
  "thereIsAnotherImportantGasMethaneOrCh4YouCan": "There is another important gas, methane or CH‚ÇÑ. You can see some white particles here. That's it! Note that methane, although smaller in volume, affects the Pollution bar 80 times more than carbon dioxide.",
  "althoughThereIsMuchLessMethaneInTheAtmosphereThan": "Although there is much less methane in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, it can cause more than 80 times more powerful greenhouse effect. Methane is a wonderful gas. Over time, it turns into carbon dioxide.",
  "inThisGameTheCitiesAreTheOnlySourceOf": "In this game, the cities are the only source of carbon dioxide. The larger the population of the city and the lower the average level of awareness of the city dwellers, the more carbon dioxide it creates. By tapping on the town you can hasten the awareness of the townspeople üßê\n\nAs awareness increases, citizens also consume less animal-based foods, which helps reduce the amount of methane.",
  "youCanSeeTheseBlueParticlesComingFromTheCities": "You can see these blue particles coming from the cities. That's carbon dioxide or CO‚ÇÇ. If there's too much CO‚ÇÇ, you're going to lose. Luckily plants can absorb it üòç",
  "theOceansAbsorbUpTo30OfTheCarbonDioxide": "The oceans absorb up to 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere due to human activity. Phytoplankton - microscopic plants drifting in the water - play a key role in absorbing CO‚ÇÇ by the oceans.",
  "weatherDisastersLikeFiresOrTornadoesWereAlsoPlannedFor": "Weather disasters like fires or tornadoes were also planned for this game. But not this time üôÉ",
  "globalWarmingIsAlsoDestroyingClimateStabilityAndIncreasingThe": "Global warming is also destroying climate stability and increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters.",
  "itsAFarmItRaisesAnimalsForFoodnsoundsWildDoesnt": "It's a farm. It raises animals for food. This is very sad.. üòî\n\nIn the process of digesting food, the animals produce methane (CH‚ÇÑ).",
  "theMajorityOfHumanproducedMethaneComesFromLivestockFarming": "The majority of human-produced methane comes from livestock farming.",
  "theFieldsProvideCitiesAndFarmsWithPlantFoodOf": "Fields provide cities and farms with plant food.",
  "mostOfTheFoodGrownInTheFieldsIsUsed": "Most of the food grown in the fields is used to feed farm animals. If all people switched to a plant-based diet, we could reduce the number of fields by many times and return these areas to the wild.",
  "wellItsPrettySimpleNifYouCanFillInThe": "Well, it's pretty simple üòÅ\n\nIf you manage to fill the green bar, you win.\n\nIf the orange bar fills up before you do, you lose.\n\nYou need to get rid of the excess gas by planting trees and raising awareness.\n\nGood luck!",
  "atTheTopOfTheScreenYouCanSeeThe": "At the top of the screen you can see the interface.\n\nThe left blue part contains counters for both gases.\n\nThe green Awareness bar shows the average level of awareness of the townspeople.\n\nThe orange Pollution bar shows the level of gassing of the area. If it is filled, the effects of global warming will become irreversible and you will lose.",
  "treesUseCo2BlueParticlesToGrowTheLargestTree": "Trees use CO‚ÇÇ (blue particles) to grow. A mature tree no longer absorbs the gas, but you can tap on it to make it drop its cones. New trees grow from these cones üòä\n\nThere is also a chance of getting a cone if you tap on the grass.",
  "plantsGainMassMainlyByConvertingCarbonDioxideIntoCarbohydrate": "Plants gain mass mainly by converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrate. Thus, the more active a plant grows, the more carbon dioxide it absorbs.",
  "hiTherenweAreFacingTheProblemOfGlobalWarmingYouve": "Hi there!\n\nWe are facing the problem of global warming. You've probably heard about it by now üò≤\n\nWell, we need a hero to clean up the mess.\n\nCould that be you? Definitely! Let's get to work.",
